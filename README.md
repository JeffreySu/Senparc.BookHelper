# Senparc.BookHelper

Senparc.BookHelper can help authors to finishing book chapters and manage resources such as code, table, URL, picture,  etc. 

With BookHelper, readers can search resources which published (printed) in the book. Who just need to copy the content (or just click the hyper-link) in the BookHelper instead of manual input.
